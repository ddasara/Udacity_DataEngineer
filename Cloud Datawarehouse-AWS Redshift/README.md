A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

In this project, we will create an ETL pipeline to build a data warehouses hosted on Redshift.

Application of Data warehouse and AWS to build an ETL Pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift Will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL Statements that create fact and dimension tables from these staging tables to create analytics.

Fact Table: songplays
Dimension Tables: users, songs, artists and time.

The data is queried from s3 buckets hosten at AWS

Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.
